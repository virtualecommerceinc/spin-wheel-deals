# SEO Audit – Spin Wheel Deals

## Clarification Gate (completed before edits)
- **Architecture observed:** static HTML site under `/spin-wheel-deals/` with shared CSS/JS and weekly blog archive pages.
- **Do-not-break components respected:** spinner/game JavaScript (`script.js`), Amazon outbound behavior, existing styling/backgrounds, blog rendering script on `blog.html`.
- **Missing external constraints:** no git remote configured in this clone, so syncing/pulling `main` was not possible in this environment.

## Findings and Changes
- Added GA4 snippet (`G-FBJX9QPT1W`) across all HTML pages for consistent tracking.
- Added missing `og:image` and `twitter:image` tags sitewide.
- Added FAQ/quick-answer content on key hub pages (`index.html`, `blog.html`, `dog-health.html`) to improve GEO readiness.
- Added FAQPage JSON-LD to homepage and blog index.
- Expanded footer internal links to strengthen crawl paths (Blog, Game, Dog Health, Contact, Privacy, Affiliate Disclosure).
- Added `affiliate-disclosure.html` and included it in footer and sitemap.
- Regenerated `sitemap.xml` to include all indexable HTML pages in this repository.

## Robots + Sitemap
- `robots.txt` already allowed crawling and referenced sitemap under subfolder path.
- Sitemap available at `/spin-wheel-deals/sitemap.xml`.

## Performance quick wins
- Continue using `loading="lazy"` on non-critical images (already present on most blog cards).
- Consider converting remaining raster images to modern formats and setting explicit width/height attributes.
- Consider deferring non-critical inline scripts where possible.

## Verification Checklist
1. Validate representative pages in Rich Results / Schema validator (home, blog index, one weekly post).
2. Use GA4 DebugView to confirm `page_view` on homepage, blog index, one blog post, dog health page.
3. Inspect page source for canonical + OG + Twitter image tags.
4. Open `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml` in browser and confirm status 200.
5. Smoke-test spinner behavior and outbound Amazon click-throughs.
