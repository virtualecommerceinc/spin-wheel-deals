CORE FUNCTION:
The spinner pulls randomized toy picks from `dog_toys.json`, visually rotates a custom canvas wheel with paw/bone theme, then reveals an Amazon affiliate link the user can optionally click. All links are FTC/Compliant.

CONFIRMED:
✔ Google Analytics installed (G-FBJX9QPT1W)
✔ Schema.org structured data for SEO
✔ Affiliate disclosures shown clearly
✔ Mobile and desktop tested
✔ All styles and scripts local (no CDN required)
✔ Codex Web is the only tool used (no CLI/git)

NEXT STEPS (REQUESTED):
1. Update main `<nav>` to include Blog
2. Keep uploading images manually — use placeholders for now
3. Codex Web should always sync only changed files, never wipe

TODO:
- Add more blog posts to /blog-posts
- Expand sitemap.xml dynamically if possible
- Possibly add newsletter/email opt-in (optional)
- Create short-form content (TikTok, Instagram, Reddit bot outreach)
- Add image placeholders where needed (label with TODO)


🧠 INSTRUCTION FOR CODEX WEB:
Going forward, Codex Web should:
- Never try to upload image files or binary assets
- Always write prompts that sync/edit existing GitHub files only
- Use "Request Changes" box if GitHub binary block error occurs
- Clearly identify which files are added/edited in the commit message
- Use `<img src="assets/placeholder-TODO.jpg">` if no image exists


✅ READY FOR NEXT TASK
Please proceed by pasting updated `dog-toys.html`, next blog post HTML, or any page you'd like Codex Web to work on. This summary can be reused each time.
