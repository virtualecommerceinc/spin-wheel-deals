    <h2>How to Use This Week's Picks</h2>
    <p>Start by identifying which toy matches your dog's size, chew intensity, and play style. Rotate toys every few days to maintain novelty and prevent overuse damage. Inspect each toy weekly for cracks, loose seams, or missing pieces. Replace immediately if you find safety concerns. Most dogs show preference for 1–2 toys; use the others as backups or recovery toys when the favorite is in the wash.</p>
