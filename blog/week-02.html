    <p>Pulling ruins walks for both of you. This 14-day protocol uses toy rewards to teach loose-leash walking without frustration. By pairing toys with positive moments, your dog learns that calm walking earns the good stuff.</p>

    <h2>Quick Take (TL;DR)</h2>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Use high-value toys (not just treats) as rewards for loose-leash moments</li>
        <li>Start in low-distraction spaces; add difficulty week by week</li>
        <li>Reward every 10–15 steps of loose-leash behavior initially</li>
        <li>Change direction unpredictably to keep your dog's focus on you</li>
        <li>Most dogs show improvement within 7–10 walks with consistency</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Buyer Checklist</h2>
    <p>Before you buy, confirm you can check these boxes:</p>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>You have a 4–6 foot standard leash (long line for open space work)</li>
        <li>Choose a toy your dog values more than outdoor distractions</li>
        <li>Start on quiet street or empty parking lot (not the dog park)</li>
        <li>Reward immediately when leash goes slack; don't wait</li>
        <li>Practice 2–3 times per week minimum for visible progress</li>
        <li>Have a plan if dog gets overexcited (pause session, let them settle)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Use This Week's Picks</h2>
    <p>Start by identifying which toy matches your dog's size, chew intensity, and play style. Rotate toys every few days to maintain novelty and prevent overuse damage. Inspect each toy weekly for cracks, loose seams, or missing pieces. Replace immediately if you find safety concerns. Most dogs show preference for 1–2 toys; use the others as backups or recovery toys when the favorite is in the wash.</p>
