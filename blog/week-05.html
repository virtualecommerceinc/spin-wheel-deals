    <p>This week we're exploring top tug toys that protect teeth during intense play. Whether your dog is a power chewer, a gentle mouth, or somewhere in between, the right toy makes all the difference in playtime engagement and safety. Let's break down what makes toys last and keep your pup happy.</p>

    <h2>Quick Take (TL;DR)</h2>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Not all dogs play the same way—size, chew intensity, and play style matter</li>
        <li>Toy rotation prevents boredom and extends lifespan</li>
        <li>Quality materials = longer-lasting toys and fewer replacements</li>
        <li>Safety inspection should be weekly, not monthly</li>
        <li>Budget considerations: cheaper toys often need frequent replacement</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Buyer Checklist</h2>
    <p>Before you buy, confirm you can check these boxes:</p>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>You understand your dog's play style (fetch, tug, solo chew, squeak-crazy)</li>
        <li>Toy size is appropriate (no choking hazards)</li>
        <li>Material is durable for your dog's specific chew intensity</li>
        <li>Toy has no loose parts, bells, or fillings</li>
        <li>You have multiple toys in rotation</li>
        <li>Weekly inspection is part of your routine</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Use This Week's Picks</h2>
    <p>Start by identifying which toy matches your dog's size, chew intensity, and play style. Rotate toys every few days to maintain novelty and prevent overuse damage. Inspect each toy weekly for cracks, loose seams, or missing pieces. Replace immediately if you find safety concerns. Most dogs show preference for 1–2 toys; use the others as backups or recovery toys when the favorite is in the wash.</p>
