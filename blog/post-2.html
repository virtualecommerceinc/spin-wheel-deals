    <p>Choosing the right dog toy is more than fun—it’s essential for your dog’s safety, comfort, and enjoyment. In this guide, we’ll explore key tips for picking toys that last, keep pups engaged, and protect their teeth and health.</p>
    <h2>1. Consider Your Dog’s Size and Chewing Style</h2>
    <p>Small breeds need smaller, softer toys, while power chewers require extra-durable options. Always match toy size and material to your dog’s breed and chewing habits.</p>
    <h2>2. Look for Durable, Non-Toxic Materials</h2>
    <p>Opt for toys made from food-grade rubber or sturdy nylon. Avoid cheap plastics or dyes that can break off and become choking hazards.</p>
