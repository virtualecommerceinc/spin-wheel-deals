    <p>Small-Batch USA Dog Toy Brands with Durable Stitching. Supporting domestic dog toy brands means investing in quality control, fair labor practices, and often better customer service. This week we focus on how to verify claims and find genuinely American-made toys.</p>

    <h2>Quick Take (TL;DR)</h2>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>"Made in USA" is regulated by FTC—look for clear labeling on packaging or product page</li>
        <li>American brands often prioritize material sourcing and quality control</li>
        <li>Return and replacement policies tend to be more generous with domestic brands</li>
        <li>Price may be higher, but durability often justifies the investment</li>
        <li>Ask: Where is it made? Who owns the company? What are the materials?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Buyer Checklist</h2>
    <p>Before you buy, confirm you can check these boxes:</p>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Product explicitly states 'Made in USA' on packaging/website (not just 'designed' or 'assembled')</li>
        <li>Company has a physical US address (website, customer service, headquarters)</li>
        <li>Materials sourcing is transparent (know where fabrics/rubber come from)</li>
        <li>Return/warranty policy is clearly stated</li>
        <li>Reviews mention durability and customer service quality</li>
        <li>Price reflects quality (not suspiciously cheap for 'made in USA' claims)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Use This Week's Picks</h2>
    <p>Start by identifying which toy matches your dog's size, chew intensity, and play style. Rotate toys every few days to maintain novelty and prevent overuse damage. Inspect each toy weekly for cracks, loose seams, or missing pieces. Replace immediately if you find safety concerns. Most dogs show preference for 1–2 toys; use the others as backups or recovery toys when the favorite is in the wash.</p>
