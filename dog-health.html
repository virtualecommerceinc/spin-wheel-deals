      <h2>Feeding Calculator</h2>
      
      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Understanding Calorie Needs</h3>
        <p>Dogs need a certain number of calories each day to stay healthy. Veterinarians use two key formulas to estimate this:</p>
        
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li><strong>RER (Resting Energy Requirement)</strong> — The baseline calories your dog needs at rest. Calculated as: 70 × (body weight in kg)^0.75</li>
          <li><strong>MER (Maintenance Energy Requirement)</strong> — RER adjusted for life stage, activity level, and individual factors. This is what your dog actually needs daily.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Common Feeding Mistakes to Avoid</h4>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li><strong>Eyeballing portions</strong> — Use a measuring cup or kitchen scale for accuracy</li>
          <li><strong>Forgetting treats</strong> — Treats should make up no more than 10% of daily calories</li>
          <li><strong>Ignoring body condition</strong> — A healthy dog has a visible waist and ribs you can feel but not see</li>
          <li><strong>Same food for all life stages</strong> — Puppies, adults, and seniors have different nutritional needs</li>
          <li><strong>Free-feeding dry food</strong> — Measured meals help prevent overeating and obesity</li>

    <!-- Preventive Care Checklist -->
    <section id="preventive-care" class="checklist">
      <h2>Preventive Care Checklist</h2>
      
      <div class="content-block">
        <p>Regular preventive care helps catch health issues early when they're easier to treat. The American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) recommends wellness exams at least once a year for adult dogs, and more frequently for puppies and seniors.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Weekly Care</h3>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Check ears for redness, odor, or discharge</li>
        <li>Brush teeth (daily is ideal, but weekly at minimum)</li>
        <li>Inspect coat and skin for lumps, bumps, or irritation</li>
        <li>Monitor food and water intake</li>
        <li>Observe energy levels and bathroom habits</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Monthly Care</h3>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Administer parasite preventatives (as prescribed by your vet)</li>
        <li>Check nails and trim if needed (or as often as growth requires)</li>
        <li>Weigh your dog and track any changes</li>
        <li>Clean bedding and toys</li>
        <li>Assess body condition (can you feel ribs? is there a waist?)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Annual Veterinary Visits Should Include</h3>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Complete physical examination</li>
        <li>Core vaccinations (as recommended by your vet based on risk)</li>
        <li>Heartworm test</li>
        <li>Fecal exam for intestinal parasites</li>
        <li>Dental assessment</li>
        <li>Discussion of diet, behavior, and any concerns</li>
        <li>Blood work (especially important for seniors)</li>
        <li>Weight and body condition evaluation</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h4>Why Preventive Care Matters</h4>
        <p>Dogs age faster than humans, and many health conditions develop silently. Annual exams help detect problems like dental disease, kidney issues, or early-stage arthritis before they become serious. According to veterinary organizations, preventive care is more effective and often less costly than treating advanced illness.</p>

    <!-- Nutrition Basics -->
    <section id="nutrition-tips" class="nutrition-cards">
      <h2>Nutrition Basics</h2>
      
      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Choosing Quality Dog Food</h3>
        <p>Look for foods that meet <strong>AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials)</strong> standards. The label should state the food is "complete and balanced" for your dog's life stage. This means the food has been formulated or tested to meet established nutritional requirements.</p>
        
        <p>The World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) recommends selecting foods from companies that:</p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>Employ full-time qualified nutritionists</li>
          <li>Own their manufacturing facilities</li>
          <li>Conduct and publish research</li>
          <li>Provide detailed product information upon request</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card-group">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Puppies (Under 1-2 Years)</h3>
          <p>Require food labeled for "growth" or "all life stages." Need more calories, protein, and specific nutrients like calcium for developing bones. Large breeds need controlled growth formulas.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Adults (1-7 Years)</h3>
          <p>Need food labeled for "adult maintenance." Focus on maintaining healthy weight. Adjust portions based on activity level and body condition.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Seniors (7+ Years)</h3>
          <p>May benefit from senior formulas with adjusted calories and joint-supporting nutrients. Discuss specific needs with your vet, as senior dogs vary widely.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h4>A Note on Trendy Diets</h4>
        <p>Grain-free, raw, and homemade diets have become popular, but they require caution:</p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li><strong>Grain-free diets:</strong> The FDA has investigated a potential link between certain grain-free foods and heart disease (dilated cardiomyopathy) in dogs. Discuss with your vet before choosing grain-free.</li>
          <li><strong>Raw diets:</strong> Carry risks of bacterial contamination for both pets and humans. Not recommended by AVMA or AAHA without veterinary guidance.</li>
          <li><strong>Homemade diets:</strong> Difficult to balance properly. If you prefer homemade, work with a board-certified veterinary nutritionist.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The safest approach is to choose commercial foods that meet AAFCO standards and discuss any dietary changes with your veterinarian.</p>

    <!-- Parasites & Seasonal Safety -->
    <section id="parasite-safety" class="safety-cards">
      <h2>Parasite & Seasonal Safety</h2>
      
      <div class="content-block">
        <h3>Year-Round Prevention Is Key</h3>
        <p>Many pet owners think parasites are only a summer problem, but veterinary organizations recommend year-round prevention. Parasites can survive indoors during winter, and climate variations mean risks exist in every season. Consistent prevention is more effective than trying to catch up after an infestation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-group">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Fleas & Ticks</h3>
          <p>Beyond itching, fleas can cause allergic dermatitis and transmit tapeworms. Ticks carry serious diseases like Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Use vet-recommended preventatives consistently.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Heartworm</h3>
          <p>Transmitted by mosquitoes, heartworm disease is serious and potentially fatal. Prevention is simple and effective; treatment is expensive, lengthy, and hard on your dog. Monthly preventatives are standard.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Intestinal Parasites</h3>
          <p>Roundworms, hookworms, whipworms, and tapeworms can affect dogs of any age. Regular fecal testing and deworming (as recommended by your vet) help keep these in check.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h4>Zoonotic Awareness: Protecting Your Family</h4>
        <p>Some parasites can spread from pets to humans, especially children, elderly individuals, and those with weakened immune systems. Examples include roundworms, hookworms, and certain tick-borne diseases. Good hygiene practices help reduce risk:</p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>Wash hands after handling pets, especially before eating</li>
          <li>Pick up dog waste promptly from yards and public areas</li>
          <li>Keep children's sandboxes covered</li>
          <li>Maintain your pet's parasite prevention schedule</li>
          <li>Schedule regular veterinary fecal exams</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>Seasonal Hazards</h3>
      <div class="card-group">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Summer Safety</h3>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Never leave dogs in parked cars—temperatures rise dangerously fast</li>
            <li>Provide shade and fresh water outdoors</li>
            <li>Walk during cooler morning or evening hours</li>
            <li>Test pavement with your hand—if too hot for you, it's too hot for paws</li>
            <li>Watch for signs of heatstroke: excessive panting, drooling, lethargy</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Winter Safety</h3>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Limit time outdoors in extreme cold, especially for small or short-coated dogs</li>
            <li>Wipe paws after walks to remove salt and chemicals</li>
            <li>Check for antifreeze spills—it's toxic and tastes sweet to dogs</li>
            <li>Consider a coat or sweater for dogs with thin fur</li>
            <li>Keep dogs away from frozen ponds and lakes</li>
